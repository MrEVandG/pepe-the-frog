# General Use

These commands are categorized for the fact that literally every moderation bot should be able to do these things.
These commands were created either to train my stupid monkey brain how to code for Discord's terrible NPM library, or they were created to help me, the developer of this bot, clean up my `#bot-testing` channel. (Thank GOD for the /clear command, my channel gets so full sometimes ðŸ˜­)
